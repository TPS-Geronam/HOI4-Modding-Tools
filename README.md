# HOI4-Modding-Tools
### Duplicate loc key remover:
Comments out duplicate loc keys by first letting you select the `text.log` (auto-generated by hoi4, can be found inside `\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron IV\logs`) and then the localisation folder. Notice that the program comments out the first duplicate it can find and then moves on to the next key. In case of more than two duplicates of the same key the program can be just run again.

### Python (2.7) scripts are inside `/res/python_scripts/`
- deleteprovinceidfrom.py : deletes given province IDs from a file
- replacestatetype.py : replaces state type of states inside a folder
- replacemanpower.py : replaces manpower of states inside a folder
- copyflagdummy.py : copies a dummy flag with given TAGs
- deletestate.py : deletes a state inside history/states with ID (optimized for MapGen, change syntax if in need)
- blankallfiles.py : blanks all files inside current directory
