# HOI4-Modding-Tools
### Duplicate loc key remover:
Comments out duplicate loc keys by first letting you select the `text.log` (auto-generated by hoi4, can be found inside `\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron IV\logs`) and then the localisation folder. Notice that the program comments out the first duplicate it can find and then moves on to the next key. In case of more than two duplicates of the same key the program can be just run again.

### Python (3.9, some may be outdated (2.7)) scripts are inside `/res/python_scripts/`
- deleteprovinceidfrom.py : deletes given province IDs from a file
- replacestatetype.py : replaces state type of states inside a folder
- replacemanpower.py : replaces manpower of states inside a folder
- copyflagdummy.py : copies a dummy flag with given TAGs
- deletestate.py : deletes a state inside history/states with ID (optimized for MapGen, change syntax if in need)
- blankallfiles.py : blanks all files inside current directory
- religionscrapper.py : (only usable on eoanb) gets all religions of adjacent country history files into output.txt
- removereligion.py : (only usable on eoanb) removes all religions from adjacent country history files
- find_empty_used_loc_keys.py : finds all localisation keys within /localisation without inner text (`key:0 ""`)
- find_non_commented_events.py : finds all event IDs without a comment near them
- find_files_with_unequal_counts.py : lets the user input multiple characters; outputs files in which said characters appear an unequal amount
- add_immediate_log_to_event.py : quick and dirty way of adding a log effect to every event inside an immediate scope, backup your events first!
